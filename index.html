																				<h2>Ray's Antique Mall and Pizza</h2>

																				<p>Ray's Antique Mall and Pizza located out of Huachuca City, Arizona is a family business that one of my lifeguard coworkers out in Arizona is involved in. I had the opportunity to try this pizza one evening as he treated us to some Ray's Pizza after a shift one day, and it to be honest was not my favorite. For one, the pizza is unique in the sense that the toppings are placed on the pizza BEFORE the cheese, which can taste well when done right, but for the time I ate it, it just didn't seem all the way cooked over. From my impression, their wings are fairly popular, leading me to believe that Ray's Pizza is another Pizza and Wing joint where the wings sadly outperform the pizza.</p>

																				<p>Knead to Know Pizza is quite literally a pizza place located on Fort Huachuca, Arizona that you would need to know about in order to know where it is. I have the opportunity on some occasions to visit this place and is usually not preferrable to me personally. However, that being said, there are many different toppings to offer on their pizzas here and their side dishes are very nice as well. Additionally within the building is an 18+ area filled with gaming PC's which are available for use by paying money based on how much time you spend on them. Also in the building is a movie room, ping pong and pool tables, and even a travel agency to help book trips.</p>

																				<p>Vinny's New York Pizza is a pizza and wing joint in Sierra Vista, Arizona that remains very active in its community through various charitable promotions such as assisting the Boy Scouts and the local Buena High School band program, for example. I recently had the opportunity to come to this place for an end-of-year lifeguard party and I was pleased with the pizza here. The menu looks to have a lot of options and there are also many who have attempted their wings challenge and made it on their ever-expansive wall of fame.</p>
