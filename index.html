																				<h2>Grandma Tony's Pizza & Wings</h2>

																				<p>Need something to eat while watching a show at the well-known Gaslight Theater? Grandma Tony's is a part of the same business and location as the Gaslight Theater, and Little Anthony's Diner. Tony's even has the reputation of being among the best pizza locations in Tucson. In my opinion however, if this is the best pizza in Tucson, then I am worried to try other pizza restaurants around the city. The quality of toppings and dough was low and the balance of cheese to the rest of the pizza was overwhelming. This being said, definitely go see a Gaslight Theater show and try one of the Big Bopper milkshakes from Little Anthony's!</p>

Your Pie was a great experience, allowing full customizability of your pizza from the crust all the way up through the cheese, sauce and toppings, truly making it, Your Pie. Additionally, as a bonus for getting the pizza as a combo, you can treat yourself to some delicious gelato. I look forward to the future of Your Pie as a new growing pizza chain.</p>

However, that being said, I was able to try a sample of 90 Second Pizza in DC before going to see a live performance at Blues Alley. 90 Second Pizza prides themselves on their impressive preparation speed of traditional neapolitan pizza with their 900 degree oven made from volcanic stone brought from Vesuvio, Italy. And honestly, having a sample of this pizza was a delight, however, this wouldn't be my go-to pizza restaurant. I highly respect the level of dedication put into this restaurant though!</p>

Before visiting this place, I had never tried Detroit-style pizza, however I thoroughly enjoyed giving it a try. Detroit-style pizza is a rectangular pizza with a thick crisp crust<!--Wikipedia Citation?-->, and this place did not hold back, not only having a delicious, crisp, and rectangular crust, but also topping it with delicious parmesan cheese. I hope to try many places like this in the future, and I cannot wait my return to the great place I chanced upon!</p>

																				<p>Benny Sorrentino's prides itself on its chain of pizza restaurants that cater to college campuses with their "Virginia Slice", where they sell super-sized pizza by the slice. While the pizza itself is average, it is fun to order out a giant full pizza and take it down with friends at a party or other social event. This is a chain I will still continue to look out for even after I graduate college.</p>

Tutti Gusti's pizza meets the standards, but is definitely a place I would like to return to soon, as their side dishes look quite enticing. Definitely give it a shot if you're ever near James Madison University's new College of Business building.</p>

Incidentally, there is also a gelato place across the street that is owned by Bella Luna as well, which they will point you to after your meal. While many people enjoy higher-end pizza such as pizza from here, I, on the other hand, am not as big of a fan of margherita pizzas. This place will be tucked away in the back of my mind though if I need a pizza company to cater my wedding.</p>

The Brickhouse Tavern is in perfect location for that, being right next to the Forbes Center for the Performing Arts. Brickhouse Tavern offers a wide selection of food, including: Nachos, Sandwiches, Drinks, and most importantly, Pizza! Brickhouse Tavern's pizza is at the very least better than all of James Madison's on-campus pizza options, and is in a wonderful location closeby to campus. However, that being said, the side dishes and anything other than the pizza are of lesser quality than the pizza and the drinks, which admittedly I am not old enough to experience that side of the restaurant. Overall, a good reliable place to eat for some decent pizza!</p>

Their pizza was very delicious with the perfect amount of all layers of the pizza, from the crust all the way to the cheese and toppings, even with some nicely added spices. I would really like to return one day to experience their appetizers, but in the meantime, its nice knowing a pizza place so good you just can't wait to have the leftovers.</p>

The pizza is delicious, and their garlic knots are my all time favorite appetizer at any pizza restaurant anywhere. Additionally, they have good lunch deals and are even known for their 28" Beast Pizza, which is great for parties. Overall, I will always be trying to come back to this place time and time again when the opportunity arises.</p>

																				<p>Ray's Antique Mall and Pizza located out of Huachuca City, Arizona is a family business that one of my lifeguard coworkers out in Arizona is involved in. I had the opportunity to try this pizza one evening as he treated us to some Ray's Pizza after a shift one day, and it to be honest was not my favorite. For one, the pizza is unique in the sense that the toppings are placed on the pizza BEFORE the cheese, which can taste well when done right, but for the time I ate it, it just didn't seem all the way cooked over. From my impression, their wings are fairly popular, leading me to believe that Ray's Pizza is another Pizza and Wing joint where the wings sadly outperform the pizza.</p>

I have the opportunity on some occasions to visit this place and is usually not preferrable to me personally.

Additionally within the building is an 18+ area filled with gaming PC's which are available for use by paying money based on how much time you spend on them. Also in the building is a movie room, ping pong and pool tables, and even a travel agency to help book trips.</p>
