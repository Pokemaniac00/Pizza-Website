																				<p>Little Caesars is probably one of the lowest quality large pizza chains but still has some redeemable qualities, namely in their growing delivery market, their italian cheese bread, and their carryout lunch specials. For $5, you can get a personal deep dish pizza and a drink. Pretty solid deal for a pretty solid amount of food! Their classic pizzas however are a little more of the lower quality and cheap type that you can get for parties. Definitely look out for their new lunch deals!</p>

																				<p>My recent acquisition of a bike during the quarantine brought me to this local Italian restaurant in Harrisonburg. While named for their Lasagna, I had my eyes set on their pizza. Namely, their sicilian pepperoni pizza. I also got a side of their garlic bread. I... was disappointed in this place. Though people i've seen at work have urged me to still give this place another shot sometime. The pizza wasn't as bad as it looked. Which... is something? But the garlic bread was basically just fried bread with some garlic sprinkled on. And that was sortof uneatable. Will I ever come back again? I'm not sure, but if i'm told to give it a second try, i'll be happy to try some of their other menu options.</p>

																				<p>So this is the second pizza restaurant I have reviewed on here that cooks their ingredients underneath the cheese. And my opinion on this is that it doesn't really work that well, unless the ingredients are already cooked a little. Otherwise it leaves the toppings less cooked than the cheese. Extreme pizza was extremely cheesy, with a blend of mozzerella and cheddar, to the point where it was a little overwhelming. I'd love to give it another shot sometime but I'd rather the toppings be cooked more, oh and a little less cheese?</p>

																				<p>A long time ago, Christian's used to be one of the goto pizza restaurants for my family and I. Now, it is frankly overshadowed by some stronger locations in Charlottesville. Christian's Pizza has two locations near the University of Virginia, and one that branched out towards a local neighborhood outside the city of Charlottesville. Their pizza? Thin crust with nice ingredients topped with parmesan. If there were just a little more crust and less grease I feel like it would be easier to prefer. Also, they offer less deals and their prices are a little higher than other local locations.</p>

Vace is a take-and-bake pizza restaurant where they will cook the pizza halfway and you take it and bake the rest at home. The advantage to this is that you get the pizza fresh, and it definitely helped with the flavor! Its just a shame that with this visit that I didn't get the best service, and they also messed up my order a little. (Who cuts a take-and-bake pizza into its slices if it needs to go back into the oven?)</p>

																				<p>Campono is a fantastic wood fired pizza and gelato place that I make it a point to visit before seeing a show at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. High quality ingredients with a perfect blend of sauce, cheese, toppings, altogether on a delicious crust. I always look forward to each opportunity I get to return to this restaurant.</p>

																				<p>Bella Luna caters to its audience by being a wood fired pizza place that serves higher-end quality pizza than the average pizza place, serving margherita pizzas and high quality ingredients. Incidentally, there is also a gelato place across the street that is owned by Bella Luna as well, which they will point you to after your meal. While many people enjoy higher-end pizza such as pizza from here, I, on the other hand, am not as big of a fan of margherita pizzas. This place will be tucked away in the back of my mind though if I need a pizza company to cater my wedding.</p>

																				<p>Looking for a place to eat before seeing one of James Madison University's Forbes Center shows? The Brickhouse Tavern is in perfect location for that, being right next to the Forbes Center for the Performing Arts. Brickhouse Tavern offers a wide selection of food, including: Nachos, Sandwiches, Drinks, and most importantly, Pizza! Brickhouse Tavern's pizza is at the very least better than all of James Madison's on-campus pizza options, and is in a wonderful location closeby to campus. However, that being said, the side dishes and anything other than the pizza are of lesser quality than the pizza and the drinks, which admittedly I am not old enough to experience that side of the restaurant. Overall, a good reliable place to eat for some decent pizza!</p>

																				<p>I had heard from many in Charlottesville that Crozet Pizza was some of the best pizza they had ever had, and Crozet Pizza did not disappoint. Their pizza was very delicious with the perfect amount of all layers of the pizza, from the crust all the way to the cheese and toppings, even with some nicely added spices. I would really like to return one day to experience their appetizers, but in the meantime, its nice knowing a pizza place so good you just can't wait to have the leftovers.</p>

																				<p>End Zone Pizza is a place that I have always enjoyed during my time in Charlottesville, and had the pleasure of experiencing again before I returned to college in Harrisonburg, Virginia at James Madison University. The pizza is delicious, and their garlic knots are my all time favorite appetizer at any pizza restaurant anywhere. Additionally, they have good lunch deals and are even known for their 28" Beast Pizza, which is great for parties. Overall, I will always be trying to come back to this place time and time again when the opportunity arises.</p>

																				<p>Ray's Antique Mall and Pizza located out of Huachuca City, Arizona is a family business that one of my lifeguard coworkers out in Arizona is involved in. I had the opportunity to try this pizza one evening as he treated us to some Ray's Pizza after a shift one day, and it to be honest was not my favorite. For one, the pizza is unique in the sense that the toppings are placed on the pizza BEFORE the cheese, which can taste well when done right, but for the time I ate it, it just didn't seem all the way cooked over. From my impression, their wings are fairly popular, leading me to believe that Ray's Pizza is another Pizza and Wing joint where the wings sadly outperform the pizza.</p>

																				<p>Knead to Know Pizza is quite literally a pizza place located on Fort Huachuca, Arizona that you would need to know about in order to know where it is. I have the opportunity on some occasions to visit this place and is usually not preferrable to me personally. However, that being said, there are many different toppings to offer on their pizzas here and their side dishes are very nice as well. Additionally within the building is an 18+ area filled with gaming PC's which are available for use by paying money based on how much time you spend on them. Also in the building is a movie room, ping pong and pool tables, and even a travel agency to help book trips.</p>

																				<p>Vinny's New York Pizza is a pizza and wing joint in Sierra Vista, Arizona that remains very active in its community through various charitable promotions such as assisting the Boy Scouts and the local Buena High School band program, for example. I recently had the opportunity to come to this place for an end-of-year lifeguard party and I was pleased with the pizza here. The menu looks to have a lot of options and there are also many who have attempted their wings challenge and made it on their ever-expansive wall of fame.</p>
