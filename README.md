This project is a mix between reviewing Git, and learning HTML through coding a website that derived inspiration from another repository's website (can be found online at 100slices.pizza).

My current objective through this website is to create a Pizza Review Blog, and also any other features I feel like including.

NOTE:
This project is no longer hosted through netlify. Instead I am hosting my website through James Madison University using an old web address from my CS101 class that can be found here: w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/floraa/index.html
